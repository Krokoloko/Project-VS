description = "Ever since the reveal of Piranha plant as a playable character in SSBU I was interested if I could do the same for an enemy from the DKC games. 
After careful consideration I ended up choosing a team up between the barrel hiding Klobber and the barrel throwing Kloak.

Both were among my favorite DKC enemies and are very complimentary."
