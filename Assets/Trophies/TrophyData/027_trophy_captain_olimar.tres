One day his spaceship is hit by a meteor and he crash-lands on the planet PNF-404.
The Dolphin is very badly damaged after the crash having most of its vital parts scattered over the planets surface.
It is at this point that Olimar encounters the Pikmin species and they help him collect his missing ship parts.
Can the captain fix his ship before his air supply runs out in 30 days!? "
