description = "The last of the first four planned characters representing his own franchise. Wario is especially exciting because I always wanted to reimagine his moveset being based on the Wario Land games and Wario World.

All the playable characters current sprites are improvised or loosely based on their actual smash brothers move-sets. We intend to do a re-sprite with altered moves, more frames and better linework eventually. 

\"OH MY GOD, WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\"
