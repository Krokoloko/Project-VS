description = "Being one of the first four planned characters Kirby was partially chosen because he is easy to draw, and because of the many moveset options derived from his copy abilities.

Additionally the Kirby franchise has nice visuals and music. Many of which I would like to implement as stages.
The same goes for the other featured franchises of course.
